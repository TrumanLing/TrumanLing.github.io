title: Algorithmic Complexity
---
>Algorithmic compexity is concerned about how fast or slow particular algorithm performas. We define complexity as a numerical function T(n) - time versus the input size n. We want to define time taken by an algorithm without depending on the implementation details. ut you agree that T(n) does depend on the implementation!
